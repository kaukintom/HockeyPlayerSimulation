### Intro
Created to simulate the point production of hockey players for an NHL season and accommodate a fantasy hockey scoring system. This project would be used to aid in fantasy hockey player selection.

### About The Simulation
Simulated results are based on how a player performed in the prior season. If it was a player's first season in the NHL, then it is based on how they are categorized (when first season occured and how they performed in their first season).

Simulations are conducted using a normal distribution, with a mean and variance based on the season they are entering and how they are categorized, which was determined in another workbook.

Some category of players currently contain too few entries do develop an accurate probability distribution for, so some hockey players may not have their next season point totals simulated.
